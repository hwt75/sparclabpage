  "page.hero-section.tilte.lorem": "The project is being implemented with the aim of minimizing the risk of stillbirth and premature birth, while ensuring comprehensive development for children. An important component of the system is fetal electrocardiogram (F/mECG) technology, which allows recording and analysis of electrocardiogram signals of both mother and fetus throughout pregnancy. Small electrocardiogram pulses emitted when the heart beats will be collected and processed so that doctors can monitor the cardiovascular health of both mother and fetus, thereby detecting early signs of abnormalities and timely intervention.",
